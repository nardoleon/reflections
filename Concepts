Concepts:

- Variables, arrays, objects
This are expressions.

- Functions
Is a block of code created for run some tasks.

- Iteration loops (for and while)
The for loop can execute a block of code a number of times. The while loop can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

- Anonymous callback functions
A callback function, also known as a higher-order function, is a function that is passed to another function as a parameter, and the callback function is called (or executed) inside the outer function. 

- Promises
A promise represents the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. It is a placeholder into which the successful result value or reason for failure will materialize.



- Fie system module
Node.js includes file system module to access physical file system. The file system module is responsible for all the asynchronous or synchronous file I/O operations.

- Express
Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications. It facilitates the rapid development of Node based Web applications.Allows to set up middlewares to respond to HTTP Requests. Defines a routing table which is used to perform different actions based on HTTP Method and URL. Allows to dynamically render HTML Pages based on passing arguments to templates.

- Body parser
Body-parser extract the entire body portion of an incoming request stream and exposes it on req.body as something easier to interface with . 

- jQuery
jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.
The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.
jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.

- Pug (discuss syntax and variables)
Template language for javascript

- AJAX
AJAX is areally helpful, because you can:
Update a web page without reloading the page
Request data from a server - after the page has loaded
Receive data from a server - after the page has loaded
Send data to a server - in the background

- Cookies
Cookies are data, stored in small text files, on your computer.
When a web server has sent a web page to a browser, the connection is shut down, and the server forgets everything about the user.
Cookies were invented to solve the problem "how to remember information about the user":
When a user visits a web page, his name can be stored in a cookie.
Next time the user visits the page, the cookie "remembers" his name.

- Sequelize ORM
Sequelize is a promise-based ORM for Node.js and io.js. It supports the dialects PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and MSSQL and features solid transaction support, relations, read replication and more.
